        <h1>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis Examples</h1>

        <p>Apache ActiveMQ Artemis comes with over 90 runnable examples. These can be found in the examples directory in the root of the
        distribution folder. There are examples covering JMS as well as all the protocols and functionality that Apache ActiveMQ Artemis
        supports.</p>

        <p>Each example has its own instructions as to how they can be run, but for most of them it is as simple as running
        <code>mvn verify -Pexample</code> from the example directory. This will start a broker with the correct configuration, run the
        example and then stop the broker.  You'll need to ensure there is not a broker already running as this may conflict
        with the broker that is configured and used in the example.</p>

        <p>If you want to run an example against an already running broker then firstly you will need to start the broker using
        the example configuration. An example configuration is provided which by default to run the queue example, to run this
        use the command  <code>./activemq run --config xml:../config/examples/bootstrap.xml</code>.

        Once the server has started run the example with the command <code>mvn -DskipBrokerStart verify -Pexample</code>. If you want
        to run a different example simply edit the <code>config/examples/bootstrap.xml</code> aand change the paths to point
        the correct configuration (this will be found in the directory of the example you wish to run). By default the broker
        will use the <code>data/server0</code> directory for the journal, to avoid problems it is best to delete this
        directory between running different examples or set the <code>ACTIVEMQ_DATA_DIR</code> environment property in
        <code>activemq.conf</code>to use a different location</p>
